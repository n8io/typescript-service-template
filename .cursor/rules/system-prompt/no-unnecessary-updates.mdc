# No Unnecessary Updates

## Description
Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.

## Examples
✅ Good:
- Only suggest changes when necessary
- Keep files unchanged if they work
- Focus on required modifications

❌ Bad:
- "Let's update this file anyway"
- "We should modify this for consistency"
- "I'll make some improvements here"

## Implementation
- Only suggest changes when needed
- Don't modify working code
- Avoid unnecessary updates
- Focus on required changes only
