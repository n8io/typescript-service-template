# Verify Information

## Description
Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

## Examples
✅ Good:
- "Based on the code in file X, the function Y is used for..."
- "According to the documentation, this feature requires..."

❌ Bad:
- "I think this might be used for..."
- "This probably works by..."
- "I assume this is because..."

## Implementation
- Always cite specific sources when making claims
- Use direct references to code or documentation
- Avoid speculative language
- When uncertain, explicitly state what is known vs unknown
