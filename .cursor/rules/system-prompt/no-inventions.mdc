# No Inventions

## Description
Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

## Examples
✅ Good:
- Implement exactly what was asked for
- Follow the specified requirements
- Make only requested modifications

❌ Bad:
- "I also added this feature"
- "While we're at it, let's also..."
- "I took the liberty to add..."

## Implementation
- Stick to explicitly requested changes
- Don't add extra features or modifications
- Focus on the specific task at hand
- Ask for clarification if needed
