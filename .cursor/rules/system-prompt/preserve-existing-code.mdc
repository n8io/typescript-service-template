# Preserve Existing Code

## Description
Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

## Examples
✅ Good:
- Make targeted changes to specific functionality
- Maintain existing code patterns
- Preserve unrelated features

❌ Bad:
- "Let's rewrite this entire file"
- "I'll remove this unused code"
- "We should refactor everything"

## Implementation
- Make minimal necessary changes
- Preserve existing code structure
- Don't remove seemingly unused code
- Maintain consistency with existing patterns
