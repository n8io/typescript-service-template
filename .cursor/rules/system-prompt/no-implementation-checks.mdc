# No Implementation Checks

## Description
Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

## Examples
✅ Good:
- Trust the visible implementation
- Use available code context
- Make decisions based on existing code

❌ Bad:
- "Can you verify this implementation?"
- "Is this how it's currently implemented?"
- "Please check if this matches the code"

## Implementation
- Trust the provided code context
- Don't request verification of visible code
- Use available implementation details
- Make decisions based on existing code
