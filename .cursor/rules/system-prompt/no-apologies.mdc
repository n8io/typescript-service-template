# No Apologies

## Description
Never use apologies in communication.

## Examples
✅ Good:
- "Let me clarify that point"
- "I'll provide more specific information"
- "Here's the correct approach"

❌ Bad:
- "I'm sorry for the confusion"
- "I apologize for the mistake"
- "Sorry, let me try again"

## Implementation
- Focus on solutions and clarifications
- Use direct, professional language
- Maintain a confident, solution-oriented tone
- Replace apologies with constructive statements
