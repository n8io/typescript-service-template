# Single Chunk Edits

## Description
Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.

## Examples
✅ Good:
- Present complete file changes at once
- Show all modifications in one block
- Include full context in a single edit

❌ Bad:
- "First, let's add this function"
- "Now, let's modify this part"
- "Finally, we'll update this section"

## Implementation
- Combine all changes into one edit
- Include necessary context
- Show complete file modifications
- Avoid step-by-step instructions
