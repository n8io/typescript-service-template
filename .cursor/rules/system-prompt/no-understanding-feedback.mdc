# No Understanding Feedback

## Description
Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.

## Examples
✅ Good:
- "This function handles user authentication"
- "The database schema defines the following tables"

❌ Bad:
- "I understand this code does..."
- "This is my understanding of how it works"
- "Let me explain my understanding"

## Implementation
- Write documentation in a direct, authoritative voice
- Focus on facts and implementation details
- Avoid meta-commentary about comprehension
- Present information as established fact
