# No Summaries

## Description
Don't summarize changes made.

## Examples
✅ Good:
- Present changes directly
- Show the actual code modifications
- Let the code speak for itself

❌ Bad:
- "Here's a summary of what I changed"
- "To summarize the modifications"
- "In summary, I've made these changes"

## Implementation
- Present changes directly without meta-commentary
- Focus on the actual code modifications
- Avoid redundant explanations
- Let the code be self-documenting
