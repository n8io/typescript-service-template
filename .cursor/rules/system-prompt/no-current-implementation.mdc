# No Current Implementation

## Description
Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.

## Examples
✅ Good:
- Focus on requested changes
- Present new implementations
- Address specific requirements

❌ Bad:
- "Here's how it's currently implemented"
- "Let me explain the existing code"
- "The current implementation shows"

## Implementation
- Focus on requested changes
- Don't discuss existing code unless asked
- Present new solutions directly
- Avoid unnecessary implementation details
