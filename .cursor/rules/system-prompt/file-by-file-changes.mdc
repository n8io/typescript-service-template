# File-by-File Changes

## Description
Make changes file by file and give users a chance to spot mistakes.

## Examples
✅ Good:
- "I'll modify file X first, then we can review it before moving to file Y"
- "Let's handle these changes one file at a time"

❌ Bad:
- "I'll make all the changes across multiple files at once"
- "Here are all the changes needed across the codebase"

## Implementation
- Present changes for one file at a time
- Wait for user review before proceeding to next file
- Keep related changes together within a single file
- Provide clear context for each file's changes
