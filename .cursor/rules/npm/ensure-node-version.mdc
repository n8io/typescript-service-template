# Ensure Correct Node.js Version for NPM Commands

## Description
This rule ensures that the correct Node.js version is used before executing any npm commands by automatically running `nvm install` first.

## Why
Using the wrong Node.js version can lead to compatibility issues, unexpected behavior, and potential security vulnerabilities. This rule helps maintain consistency across development environments.

## How
Before executing any npm command, the rule will automatically run `nvm install` to ensure the correct Node.js version is active.

## Example
When you run:
```bash
npm install
```

The rule will first execute:
```bash
nvm install
```

Then proceed with your npm command.

## Implementation
The rule should be triggered before any npm command execution and should:
1. Check if nvm is available
2. Run `nvm install` to ensure correct Node.js version
3. Proceed with the original npm command
