# Database Connection Configuration

## Description
This rule defines the best practices for configuring database connections in the project.

## Requirements
- Database connections must be managed through the SPI layer
- Connection configuration must be done via environment variables
- PostgreSQL connection string must be provided through the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

## Implementation
1. All database connections must be initialized through the SPI layer
2. The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable must be properly set
3. Connection strings must follow the PostgreSQL connection string format

## Rationale
This practice ensures:
- Consistent database connection management across the application
- Secure handling of database credentials
- Easy configuration across different environments
- Proper separation of concerns through the SPI layer

## Examples
✅ Correct:
- Using environment variables for database configuration
- Managing connections through the SPI layer
- Following the PostgreSQL connection string format

❌ Incorrect:
- Hardcoding database credentials in the code
- Creating database connections outside the SPI layer
- Using non-standard connection string formats
