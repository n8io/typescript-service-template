# NVM Install Before NPM

This rule ensures that `nvm install` is run before any npm commands to guarantee the correct Node.js version is installed.

## Behavior

1. Triggers on any command that starts with `npm`
2. Automatically runs `nvm install` before executing the npm command
3. Excludes the `nvm install` command itself to prevent infinite loops

## Example

When you run:
```bash
npm install
```

The rule will first execute:
```bash
nvm install
```

Then proceed with your npm command.

## Implementation

The rule uses command pattern matching to detect npm commands and automatically runs `nvm install` as a prerequisite action.
