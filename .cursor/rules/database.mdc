# Database Guide

This project uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for database management.

## Database Structure

- Database models are defined in @src/spi/repositories/database/schema.ts
- Database migrations are automatically generated as the Domain models are changed
- Migrations are managed and applied through Drizzle Kit
- Database configuration is in [drizzle.config.ts](mdc:drizzle.config.ts)

## Working with Migrations

1. Generate migrations:
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   ```

2. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

## Database Best Practices

1. Always create migrations for schema changes
2. Use TypeScript types from Drizzle for type safety
3. Migration names are automatic whenever generated via `npm run db:migrate`
4. Test migrations in development before applying to production
5. Keep migrations idempotent when possible

## Database Connection

The database connection is managed through the SPI layer and configured via environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
