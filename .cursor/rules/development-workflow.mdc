# Development Workflow

This project is designed to be developed using Docker. Local/native development is not officially supported.

## Docker Development (Recommended)

The primary development workflow uses Docker:

1. Start the service in Docker with hot reload:
   ```bash
   npm run docker:up
   ```
   This command:
   - Builds the Docker image if needed
   - Starts the service with hot reload enabled
   - Mounts your local code into the container
   - Sets up all required dependencies

2. Build the Docker image manually (if needed):
   ```bash
   npm run docker:build
   ```

## Available Scripts

While Docker is the recommended approach, these scripts are available for reference:
- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with hot reload (not recommended)
- `npm run test` - Run tests with coverage
    - Please note, that when running tests via Chat we need to run in a subshell with (CI=true npm test) so it doesn't hang indefinitely
- `npm run lint` - Run all linting checks
- `npm run format` - Format code using Biome
- `npm run db:generate` - Generate database migrations
- `npm run db:migrate` - Apply database migrations

## Code Quality

The project enforces code quality through:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Biome for code formatting and linting
- Vitest for testing
- Drizzle for database migrations
- Branch name validation for consistent git workflow

## Environment Setup

The project uses `.env` files for configuration. Make sure to:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Update the values as needed
3. Never commit `.env` files to version control

Note: When using Docker, environment variables are automatically handled through the Docker configuration.
