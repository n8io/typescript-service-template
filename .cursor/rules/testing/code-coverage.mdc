# Code Coverage Requirements

## Description
This rule defines the code coverage requirements and best practices for the project.

## Requirements
- Minimum coverage thresholds:
  - Branches: 90%
  - Functions: 90%
  - Lines: 90%
  - Statements: 90%
- Cover all code paths in conditional statements
- Cover all function calls
- Cover all error handling cases
- Cover all edge cases

## Examples
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
nvm install && CI=true npm test

# Run focused coverage for specific file
nvm install && CI=true npm test src/models/result.test.ts --coverage.include="src/models/result.ts"
```

## Error Prevention
- Use `CI=true` to ensure tests are not run interactively
- Use coverage reports to identify gaps
- Watch for common coverage issues:
  - Missing error case coverage
  - Untested conditional branches
  - Uncovered utility functions
  - Edge cases in data validation
