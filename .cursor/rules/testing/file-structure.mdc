# Test File Structure

## Description
This rule defines the proper organization and naming of test files in the project.

## Requirements
- Test files must be co-located with the files they test
- Test files must use the `.test.ts` extension
- Test files should be in the same directory as the implementation
- Test files should mirror the structure of the implementation files

## Examples
```
✅ Correct structure:
src/
  domain/
    services/
      resource.ts
      resource.test.ts

❌ Incorrect structure:
src/
  domain/
    services/
      resource.ts
tests/
  domain/
    services/
      resource.test.ts
```

## Error Prevention
- Use Biome rules to enforce file naming conventions
- Use TypeScript path aliases to maintain proper imports
- Use IDE settings to group test files with their implementations
