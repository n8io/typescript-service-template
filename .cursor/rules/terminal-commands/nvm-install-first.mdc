# NVM Install First

## Description
This rule ensures that `nvm install` is run before executing any npm commands to maintain consistent Node.js version usage across the project.

## Why
Running `nvm install` before npm commands ensures that the correct Node.js version is being used, preventing version mismatch issues and maintaining consistency across the development team.

## How
1. Always run `nvm install` before executing any npm commands
2. This ensures the correct Node.js version is active in your environment
3. The command will install the version specified in `.nvmrc` if it exists

## Example
```bash
# Correct way
nvm install
npm install

# Incorrect way
npm install  # Without running nvm install first
```
