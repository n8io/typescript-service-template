# Use NPM Scripts

## Description
This rule emphasizes the importance of using predefined npm scripts from package.json instead of running commands directly.

## Why
Using npm scripts provides consistency, simplifies command execution, and ensures that all team members use the same command configurations and options.

## How
1. Check package.json for available scripts before running custom commands
2. Use `npm run <script-name>` to execute predefined scripts
3. Avoid running commands directly when an equivalent npm script exists

## Example
```bash
# Correct way
npm run build
npm run test
npm run start

# Incorrect way
tsgo  # Instead of npm run build
jest  # Instead of npm run test
node dist/index.js  # Instead of npm run start
```
