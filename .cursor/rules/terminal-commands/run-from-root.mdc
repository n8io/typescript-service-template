# Run Commands from Project Root

## Description
This rule ensures that all terminal commands are executed from the project root directory to maintain consistency and prevent path-related issues.

## Why
Running commands from the project root ensures that all relative paths and configurations are correctly resolved, preventing unexpected behavior and maintaining consistency across different environments.

## How
1. Always navigate to the project root directory before running commands
2. Use `cd` to change to the project root if you're in a subdirectory
3. Verify you're in the correct directory by checking for key project files (package.json, etc.)

## Example
```bash
# Correct way
cd /path/to/project/root
npm install

# Incorrect way
cd /path/to/project/root/src
npm install  # Running from subdirectory
```
