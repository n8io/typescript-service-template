# Troubleshooting Common Issues

## Description
This rule provides a structured approach to troubleshooting common issues with npm and Node.js in the project.

## Why
Having a systematic approach to troubleshooting helps resolve issues quickly and maintains project stability.

## How
1. Clear npm cache when experiencing package-related issues:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

2. Reset node_modules when experiencing dependency issues:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   nvm install
   npm install
   ```

3. Follow the troubleshooting steps in order:
   - Start with cache clearing
   - If issues persist, proceed with node_modules reset
   - Ensure correct Node.js version is installed

## Example
```bash
# Complete troubleshooting process
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
nvm install
npm install
```
