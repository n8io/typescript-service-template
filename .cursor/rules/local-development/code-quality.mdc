# Code Quality Tools

## Description
This rule defines the code quality tools and practices that must be followed in the project.

## Requirements
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use Biome for code formatting and linting
- Use Vitest for testing
- Use Drizzle for database migrations
- Follow branch name validation for consistent git workflow

## Rationale
These tools ensure consistent code quality, type safety, and maintainable codebase across the project.

## Examples
✅ Good:
```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm run test

# Generate database migrations
npm run db:generate

# Apply database migrations
npm run db:migrate
```

❌ Bad:
```bash
# Skipping code quality checks
git commit -m "Quick fix" --no-verify
```
