# Docker Development

## Description
This rule enforces the use of Docker for local development, which is the recommended approach for this project.

## Requirements
- Use Docker for local development instead of native development
- Use `npm run docker:up` to start the service with hot reload
- Use `npm run docker:build` to manually build the Docker image when needed

## Rationale
Docker provides a consistent development environment, ensures all dependencies are properly configured, and simplifies the setup process for new developers.

## Examples
✅ Good:
```bash
npm run docker:up
```

❌ Bad:
```bash
npm run dev  # Native development is not recommended
```
