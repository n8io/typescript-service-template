# Test Execution

## Description
This rule defines the proper way to execute tests in the project, particularly when running tests with an Agent.

## Requirements
- Run tests with coverage using `npm run test`
- When running tests via Chat, use `CI=true npm test` to prevent hanging
- Ensure all tests pass before committing changes

## Rationale
Proper test execution ensures code quality and prevents regressions. The CI environment variable prevents test runners from hanging in certain environments.

## Examples
✅ Good:
```bash
# Normal test execution
npm run test

# Test execution via Chat
CI=true npm test
```

❌ Bad:
```bash
# Running tests without CI flag in Chat environment
npm test  # May hang indefinitely
```
