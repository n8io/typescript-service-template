# Environment Setup

## Description
This rule defines the proper way to handle environment configuration in the project.

## Requirements
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local development
- Update environment variables in `.env` as needed
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- When using Docker, environment variables are handled through Docker configuration

## Rationale
Proper environment configuration ensures consistent behavior across different development environments and prevents sensitive information from being exposed in version control.

## Examples
✅ Good:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with appropriate values
```

❌ Bad:
```bash
# Committing .env files
git add .env
git commit -m "Add environment configuration"
```
