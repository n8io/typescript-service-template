# Branch Subject Format Convention

## Description
This rule enforces the format for optional subjects in branch names.

## Rule
When including a subject in a branch name:
- Must start with a hyphen after the ticket number
- Must contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Must be lowercase
- Must be descriptive but concise

## Examples
✅ Valid:
- `feat/ABC-123-add-user-authentication`
- `fix/ABC-456-login-error`
- `chore/ABC-101-update-dependencies`

❌ Invalid:
- `feat/ABC-123_Add_User_Authentication`
- `fix/ABC-456 Login Error`
- `chore/ABC-101#update-dependencies`
- `feat/ABC-123-Add-User-Authentication`

## Rationale
Consistent subject formatting improves readability and makes branch purposes immediately clear to team members.
