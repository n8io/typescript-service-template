# Ticket Number Format Convention

## Description
This rule enforces the required format for ticket numbers in branch names.

## Rule
Ticket numbers in branch names must follow the format `ABC-123` where:
- `ABC` is the project prefix (letters only)
- `123` is the ticket number (numbers only)
- The prefix and number are separated by a hyphen

## Examples
✅ Valid:
- `feat/ABC-123`
- `fix/XYZ-456`
- `chore/PROJ-789`

❌ Invalid:
- `feat/123-ABC`
- `fix/ABC123`
- `chore/ABC_123`
- `feat/123`

## Rationale
Consistent ticket number formatting ensures proper tracking and reference of work items across the project.
