# Branch Type Prefix Convention

## Description
This rule enforces the required type prefix for feature and bugfix branches.

## Rule
All feature and bugfix branches must start with one of the following type prefixes:
- `feat/`: For new features
- `fix/`: For bug fixes
- `hotfix/`: For urgent production fixes
- `chore/`: For maintenance tasks
- `test/`: For test-related changes

## Examples
✅ Valid:
- `feat/ABC-123`
- `fix/ABC-456`
- `hotfix/ABC-789`
- `chore/ABC-101`
- `test/ABC-202`

❌ Invalid:
- `feature/ABC-123`
- `bugfix/ABC-456`
- `ABC-123`
- `new-feature/ABC-123`

## Rationale
Using consistent type prefixes helps categorize changes and maintain a clear history of modifications in the repository.
