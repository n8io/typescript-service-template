# Main Branch Naming Convention

## Description
This rule enforces the naming convention for main branches in the repository.

## Rule
Main branches must be named exactly as one of the following:
- `develop`
- `candidate`
- `main`

## Examples
✅ Valid:
- `develop`
- `candidate`
- `main`

❌ Invalid:
- `master`
- `staging`
- `production`
- `main-branch`

## Rationale
Maintaining consistent main branch names across the repository ensures clear understanding of the codebase's structure and deployment flow.
