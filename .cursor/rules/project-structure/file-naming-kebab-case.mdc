# File Naming: Use Kebab Case

## Description
All files in the project must use kebab-case naming convention.

## Examples
✅ Valid:
- `user-service.ts`
- `database-connection.ts`
- `api-routes.ts`

❌ Invalid:
- `userService.ts`
- `database_connection.ts`
- `UserService.ts`

## Rationale
Kebab-case provides consistency across the codebase and is more readable in URLs and file paths. It follows common web development conventions and makes the codebase more maintainable.

## Implementation
When creating new files or renaming existing ones, ensure the filename:
1. Uses lowercase letters
2. Uses hyphens (-) to separate words
3. Does not use underscores or camelCase
