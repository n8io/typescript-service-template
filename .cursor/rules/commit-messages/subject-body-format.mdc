# Commit Message Subject and Body Format

## Description
Defines the formatting requirements for commit message subjects and bodies.

## Rule
Subject must:
- When possible, the subject's ticket number can and should be derived from the branch name
- Start with a capital letter
- Be a single line
- Not end with a period
- Be written in the imperative (as you would instruct a person to do some work)

Body (optional) must:
- Be separated from the subject by a blank line
- Can contain multiple lines
- Can include bullet points
- Bullet points should be written in the imperative

## Examples
✅ Valid:
```
feat(ABC-123): ✨ Implement new feature
fix(XYZ-987): 🐛 Resolve issue with login

- Do a thing
- Apply an update to this other file
- Move this code over there
```

❌ Invalid:
```
feat(ABC-123): ✨ implement new feature
fix(XYZ-987): 🐛 Fix bug.
feat(ABC-123): ✨ Add feature
Additional details without blank line
```

## Notes
- Subject must be imperative and clear
- Body is optional but must be properly formatted if present
- Bullet points should be complete sentences
- No trailing punctuation in subject
- Must maintain proper spacing between sections
